# Welcome
Service Query (http://ServiceQuery.com) is an open-source library that allows dynamically querying data over service boundaries. It leverages the power of an  expressions builder and a simple model that is capable of serializing query instructions and returning data with support for numerous popular relational (SQL) and document (NoSQL) database engines that support an IQueryable interface to their data. This provides your front end applications unprecedented queryability as well as a standardized endpoint for a microservice-based architecture supporting polyglot data access.
